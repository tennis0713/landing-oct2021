# What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework & is meant for developing mobile friendly websites with relative ease. A CSS Framework is essentially a library of CSS files that is put together to make it simpler for a developer to create amazing sites without the hassle of having to come up with classes and styling every single time a new project comes up
 

# What is [GitHub](https://github.com/)?
**[GitHub](https://github.com/)** is an online open source version control software that allows multiple people to collaborate and make separate changes to websites simultaneously. So what does that mean exactly? Basically it means that it keeps record of all the changes you make when editing a project, while also allowing you to collaborate with team members without overwriting each others changes.
